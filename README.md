# Azul-Game

This project simulates an Azul game using the Prolog programming language. 

## Starting
To use the project, clone it or download it to your local computer.


### Requirements üìã
It is necessary to have `swi-prolog`, version `7.6.4`, to use the project rules to run the game and the test suit. 

To install the depencies run:
```
make install
```


### Execution ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

To execute the project, just open the console from the root location of the project and execute:
```
make run
```
The previous rule run a standard game of 4 players and 9 factories. To modify this values change the Makefile parameters:
```
make run players=3 fac=5
```

After that you could see the description of the game events in `log.log` file by default, but this behavior is modifiable using the `file` variable. If you need more details about the game events, change the variable `level` to **debug**:
```
make run file=myfile.log level=debug
```

Additionally to see how to run the test suit use:
```
make help
```
